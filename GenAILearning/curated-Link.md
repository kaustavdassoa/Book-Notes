### Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server List [Added on : 01/07/2025]

An MCP server, or Model Context Protocol server, facilitates the standard communication between generative AI apps and the data they utilize, to simplify and accelerate the development of accurate and robust AI systems.The need for MCP servers arises from the challenges in managing massive volumes of data scattered across various sources. Enterprises often struggle with integrating and effectively using this data, especially when it's siloed in different systems. MCP servers provide an effective solution for ensuring that LLMs get the right data at the right time, reducing the chances of AI hallucinations and other errors.
