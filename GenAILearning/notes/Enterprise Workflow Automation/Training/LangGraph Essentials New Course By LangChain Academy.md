#### Summarization :

New Announces  **LangChain Academy course: LangGraph Essentials**, where one can learn the basics of LangGraph in under an hour, available in both Python and TypeScript. 

**LangGraph** is described as a low-level orchestration framework made for building AI agents, providing a durable runtime with graph-based execution and modular components.The course is available for free enrollment, and further details about LangGraph are also provided in the video description.

**Key points:**

- LangGraph enables flexible, agentic workflows, allowing for control, state management, scalable architecture, and human intervention where needed.
- It specifically tackles challenges posed by large language models, such as:
    - **Latency**, through streaming and parallel execution.
    - **Reliability**, via checkpointing for retries and human interventions.
- The framework is influenced by user feedback and broad LangChain adoption, aiming for control and durability in production agent workflows rather than heavy abstraction.
- Companies like **LinkedIn, Uber, and Klarna** are already using LangGraph in production.
- The course covers essential building blocks and provides a hands-on quickstart, guiding users through creating workflows and building a sample agent.
