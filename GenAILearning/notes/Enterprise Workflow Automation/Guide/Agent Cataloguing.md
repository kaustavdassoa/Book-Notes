## Agent Interaction Matrix

| **Triggering Agent** | **Called Agent(s)** | **Interaction Type** | **Data Exchanged** | **Timing** | **Failure Handling** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| AGT-001 (Intake Validator) | AGT-002 (Spam Detection), AGT-003 (Priority Scoring) | Sequential | Validated request object | Immediate after validation | Continue with default priority if AGT-003 fails; block if AGT-002 fails |
| AGT-003 (Priority Scoring) | AGT-004 (Skill-Based Routing) | Sequential | Priority score, request requirements | Triggered by intake completion | Use medium priority default |
| AGT-004 (Skill-Based Routing) | AGT-005 (Workload Balancing) | Validation | Proposed assignment, expert workload | Before assignment confirmation | Override workload concerns if critical request |
| AGT-006 (Document Extraction) | AGT-007 (Vendor Enrichment), AGT-008 (Budget Validation) | Parallel | Extracted entities (vendor names, amounts) | After successful extraction | Each agent handles missing data independently |
| AGT-009 (Policy Compliance) | AGT-011 (Approval Routing) | Conditional | Policy violations, required approvals | If compliance issues detected | Manual routing if automated fails |
| AGT-011 (Approval Routing) | AGT-012 (Approval AI Judge) | Monitoring | Approval decisions, decision context | Real-time for each decision | Continue workflow if judge unavailable |
| AGT-013 (Bias Detection) | AGT-004 (Skill-Based Routing) | Feedback Loop | Bias metrics, adjustment recommendations | Daily batch + critical real-time | Log for manual review if feedback fails |
| AGT-014 (SLA Monitor) | AGT-005 (Workload Balancing), AGT-016 (Escalation Management) | Alert-based | SLA breach predictions, risk levels | Continuous monitoring | Alert management if automation fails |
| AGT-019 (Closure Validation) | AGT-020 (Retrospective Analysis), AGT-021 (Feedback Collection) | Sequential | Completed request, closure confirmation | Post-closure | Best-effort; don't block closure |
| AGT-023 (Model Performance Monitor) | All ML-based Agents | Monitoring | Model IDs, performance metrics | Continuous | Use last known state if monitoring fails |
| AGT-025 (Integration Health Monitor) | AGT-007, AGT-008, AGT-017 (all integration-dependent agents) | Infrastructure | Health status, availability | Continuous | Circuit breaker activation |

## Agent Configuration Template

For each agent implementation, maintain the following configuration:

```yaml
agent_config:
  agent_id: "AGT-XXX"
  agent_name: "Agent Name"
  version: "x.y.z"
  
  deployment:
    environment: ["production", "staging", "development"]
    replicas: 3
    resource_limits:
      cpu: "2 cores"
      memory: "4 GB"
      timeout: "30 seconds"
  
  interfaces:
    input_schema: "schema_v1.json"
    output_schema: "schema_v2.json"
    api_endpoint: "/api/v1/agents/agent-name"
    
  integrations:
    - name: "External System 1"
      type: "REST API"
      endpoint: "https://api.example.com"
      auth_method: "OAuth2"
      circuit_breaker: true
      timeout: "10s"
      retry_policy:
        max_attempts: 3
        backoff: "exponential"
  
  decision_authority:
    autonomous_threshold: 0.90
    escalation_threshold: 0.60
    auto_reject_threshold: 0.30
    
  monitoring:
    success_rate_alert: "<95%"
    latency_alert: ">5s p95"
    error_rate_alert: ">5%"
    
  audit:
    log_level: "INFO"
    sensitive_data_handling: "REDACT"
    retention_period: "7 years"
    
  human_escalation:
    - trigger: "confidence < 0.60"
      escalate_to: "team_lead"
      sla: "2 hours"
    - trigger: "high_risk_flag == true"
      escalate_to: "risk_manager"
      sla: "30 minutes"
```


## Key Usage Patterns

### For New Agent Development:

1. Assign unique Agent ID from registry sequence[^1][^2][^3]
2. Define clear input/output contracts with schema validation[^2][^4][^5]
3. Establish decision authority thresholds and escalation criteria[^6][^7][^8]
4. Implement comprehensive audit logging for all actions[^9][^10][^11]
5. Define human escalation triggers and recipients[^7][^12][^6]
6. Set SLA targets and monitoring alerts[^13][^14][^15]
7. Document integration dependencies and failure modes[^5][^16][^17]

### For Agent Governance:

- Maintain version control with semantic versioning[^18][^19]
- Track agent performance metrics against SLA targets[^15][^20][^13]
- Conduct regular agent audits for compliance and bias[^21][^22][^23]
- Review and update decision thresholds based on outcomes[^19][^24][^18]
- Ensure documentation stays current with implementations[^20][^9]

This table format provides a comprehensive, production-ready framework for documenting and managing all agents in your Agentic AI workflow automation solution, ensuring clarity, traceability, and operational excellence.[^3][^11][^25][^26][^27][^1][^2][^9][^20]
